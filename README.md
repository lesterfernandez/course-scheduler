# Course Scheduler

User can log in, input courses that they want to take, and list out each course's prerequisites.
The application will topologically sort the user's schedule and save it to their account.
The course will show what courses the student can currently take, while the ones they can't take will be greyed out.
As a user marks courses as complete, the next courses in the schedule will begin to show as available.
